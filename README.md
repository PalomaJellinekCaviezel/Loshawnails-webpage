# Loshawnails Web Site

This is the website of a manicure business where different services are offered from a catalog view, and then the potential customer is invited to contact through social networks or whatsapp to get an appointment.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- easily access detailed descriptions of each service, including a catalog of images of the work performed.
- visit the salon's social networks, such as Pinterest and Instagram, through redirection icons.
- contact directly via WhatsApp for faster and more direct communication.
- visualize the exact location of the salon via Google Maps.
